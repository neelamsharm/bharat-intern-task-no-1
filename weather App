This repository contains the code for building a simple yet functional weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to provide users with current weather information and a three-day forecast for any city worldwide by leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API. This project serves as an excellent resource for learning web development techniques, particularly in integrating third-party APIs and handling asynchronous operations.
